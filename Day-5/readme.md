# Day 5: Functions and Modular Programming

## **Task**: Create and use functions to in Python.

## I dont know how functions work in Python So lets learn together. Ask Ganesh if you have any doubts I guess.

**Description**:
Functions are an essential part of Python, allowing you to break down your code into reusable blocks. Using functions helps to keep your code clean, organized, and easier to manage. Functions can take inputs, process them, and return outputs. By modularizing your code, you can avoid repetition and improve maintainability.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Defining Functions**: Use the `def` keyword to define a function.
- **Calling Functions**: Execute a function by calling its name.


**Example**:
```python
# Define a function to greet a user
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Calling the function
print(greet("Alice"))
